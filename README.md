# ParadigmTaskFromCodewars
i only used webpack for practicing it.
it was a task i have found on codewars.

You can see my result for this task in the dist folder.

The Task:
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. 
For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, 
because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

-Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. 
-Return True if it is, False if not.(For Codewars) but here i did it differently so you can put the senctence into a form and after submiting it you can see the result.
-Ignore numbers and punctuation.
